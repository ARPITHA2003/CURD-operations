# CURD-operations
This is a React application that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user data. It uses Axios to handle HTTP requests to a local backend API (db.json). The project focuses primarily on the functionality of adding, deleting, and editing user information, without extensive emphasis on styling with CSS.
